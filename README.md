## Projects

There are many possible implementations of the ACE Framework. Rather than detail every possible permutation, here is a list of categories that we perceive as likely and viable.

1. **Personal Assistant and/or Companion**
   - This is a self-contained version of ACE that is intended to interact with one user. 
   - Think of Cortana from HALO, Samantha from HER, or Joi from Blade Runner 2049. (yes, we recognize these are all sexualized female avatars)
   - The idea would be to create something that is effectively a personal Executive Assistant that is able to coordinate, plan, research, and solve problems for you.
   - This could be deployed on mobile, smart home devices, laptops, or web sites.
2. **Game World NPC's**
   - This is a kind of game character that has their own personality, motivations, agenda, and objectives. Furthermore, they would have their own unique memories.
   - This can give NPCs a much more realistic ability to pursue their own objectives, which should make game experiences much more dynamic and unpredictable, thus raising novelty.
   - These can be adapted to 2D or 3D game engines such as PyGame, Unity, or Unreal.
3. **Autonomous Employee**
   - This is a version of the ACE that is meant to carry out meaningful and productive work inside a corporation.
   - Whether this is a digital CSR or backoffice worker depends on the deployment.
   - It could also be a "digital team member" that primarily interacts via Discord, Slack, or Microsoft Teams.
4. **Embodied Robot**
   - The ACE Framework is ideal to create self-contained, autonomous machines.
   - Whether they are domestic aid robots or something like WALL-E
